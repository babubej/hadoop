Different parameter and their explanation:

    SET hive.execution.engine=tez; 

    //Enabling Tez for Hive Queries

    SET tez.queue.name=etl; 

    // tez.queue.name property to specify which queue will be used for Tez jobs

    // Capacity Scheduler is the default scheduler in HDP

    //If no queues are configured, the default queue is used, which means that 100% of the cluster capacity is used to run Tez jobs

    SET hive.auto.convert.join=false;

    //CDH5 and above, default value for Hive.auto.convert.join is true.

    If you are dealing with huge data, suggest you to set this to false to avoid memory issues at run time.

    SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;

    SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;

    //both are used together to make dynamic parition if you not aware of partition before loading the data

    SET mapreduce.job.queuename=etl

    // Queue to which a job is submitted

    SET mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb=1535

    //The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files, in megabytes. By default, gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks

    SET mapred.reduce.tasks=100;

    // The default number of reduce tasks per job
